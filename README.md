🌐 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🌐

I recently completed a UI design for a Google Translate-like application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Django for the backend! 🎨💻 Additionally, I incorporated AJAX for seamless real-time updates without refreshing the page, enhancing the user experience.

Key Features:
Language Dropdowns: Easily select languages for translation.
Text Input: Enter any text you want to translate.
AJAX Integration: Experience smooth and fast translations without page reloads.
Responsive Design: Looks great on all devices!
